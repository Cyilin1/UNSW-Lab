Here is an AI generated explanation. Be careful - it may be wrong!

Based on the given output, it seems that the error "Failed to read pathname from TABI file: Success" occurred when trying to read the pathname from the TABI file in the stage_2 function of the program. 

The error message "Success" indicates that the fread function returned a success status (i.e., it successfully read the data), but the expected number of bytes was not read. This suggests that there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual lengths of the data being read.

To troubleshoot this issue, we need to examine the code in question and identify any potential problems.
In this code snippet, the program expects to read one instance of uint16_t (2 bytes) from the TABI file. The returned value pathname_length should contain the length of the pathname data.

Possible causes for the error:

1. The TABI file being read may not have been created correctly in the previous stage (stage 1). It's worth checking the stage_1 function to ensure that the file is generated properly, and the pathname length is correctly written.

2. The data being read may not match the expected format. This could be caused by discrepancies between the writing and reading methods. It's important to ensure that the data is being written and read in the same format, using the correct functions (fwrite and fread).

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Double-check the implementation of the stage_1 function to ensure that pathname lengths are correctly written to the TABI file. Make sure the values being written match the expected format.

2. Debug the stage_2 function by printing the value of pathname_length immediately after reading it. Confirm that the value matches your expectations.

3. Check the format and structure of the TABI file generated in stage_1. You can use a hex editor or a hexdump tool to examine the file contents and verify that they align with the expected format.

4. Ensure that the TABI file is available and accessible in the specified location (in_filename). Check the file permissions and confirm that it exists in the specified directory.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify any potential issues and resolve the error "Failed to read pathname from TABI file: Success".
